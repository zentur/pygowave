Random things about federation.

First: Federation support is not complete and basically does not work. However here is information about it

Federation support is (like in google's fedone) implemented as an xmpp component (see XEP-0114), but
since recent development makes pygowave more independent from other software, it might eventually bring
it's own xmpp server. That however won't happen before version 2.

Setting up Federation support:

1. Configure your jabber server to accept the connection from the component.
   If you have an ejabberd server like me, add the following lines to ejabberd.cfg:

   {5275, ejabberd_service, [{host, "wave.YOUR-DOMAIN.TLD",
                               [{password, "SOMEPASSWORD"}]}]},

   Note: This makes it possible to run the component on a different server than your jabber server.

2. Configure pygowave

   In the settings.py file, add/edit the following lines to suit the values you chose above

    XMPP_ID = "wave.YOUR-DOMAIN.TLD"
    XMPP_PASSWORD = "SOMEPASSWORD"
    XMPP_PORT = 5275
    XMPP_HOST = "localhost"


3. Run the component

   Currently the federation part runs as a seperate process, this will change later.
   To start the server and let it run in the foreground:

    twistd -ny pygowave-xmpp.tac


ToDo list and other things

 - Finish protocol implementation
 - Read more options from the settings.py file
 - Switch to the pygowave rpc code and remove dependency on txampq
 - Server Discovery to discover remote wave servers
 - Better integration of protocol buffers into the ORM
 - many more...
